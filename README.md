# ApplyFlow – Job Application Manager

**ApplyFlow – Job Application Manager** is a modern, responsive web application built with **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript** to help users easily organize, track, and manage their job applications. You can add jobs, update their status (Pending / Interview / Rejected), filter them, and the app saves data in your browser using LocalStorage.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Add new job applications
- ✅ Track job status (Pending, Interview, Rejected)

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **LocalStorage** (for persistence)

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. When the page loads, the app restores saved jobs from LocalStorage.
2. You can **add new jobs** using the form.
3. Each job starts in **Pending** status.
4. You can mark jobs as **Interview** or **Rejected**.
5. Filter buttons show jobs by status.
6. Counters update automatically as jobs change.
7. LocalStorage keeps your data so refresh won’t erase it.
